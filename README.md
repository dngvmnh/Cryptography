## Project Description

**1. Overview**

This is a Digital Security System Design involving some cryptographic algorithms such as Caesar, ChaCha, AES, Prince. Cryptography has been driven by escalating security challenges, especially lightweight encryption. The primary objective of this research is the design and implementation of electronic circuits, specializing in encryption algorithms and lightweight encryption, targeting preconfigured microcontrollers. This study aims to develop and implement data encryption within limited hardware such as microcontroller environments. Its results can be applied to subsequent research in the same field.

**2. The PIISE Program**

This research project is carried out within the PTNK Initiative in Interdisciplinary Science and Engineering (PIISE) Summer Research Internship Program under the topic Information Technology at DESLAB - University of Science from July 27, 2023 to October 29, 2023. The program is established and ran by PTNK (VNU-HCM High School for The Gifted) PIISE organization.

## Implementation

The implementation of this project includes three main stages: designing our own Printed Circuit Board, Assembling FPGA, System on Chip and simulating cryptographic algorithms.

-	The schematic and layout of our PCB can be found here: [Design folder]( https://github.com/dngvmnh/Cryptography/tree/main/Solar_Charger)
  
-	We used Intel DE10 Standard FPGA Board in order to assemble a preconfigured microcontroller. The SoC System use the Nios 2 CPU as the processor.
  
-	This project delved into to the application of Bolean Algebra: Full and Half Adder 1 Bit. In many computers and other kinds of processors, adders are used in the arithmetic logic units (ALUs)used to calculate addresses, table indices, increment and decrement operators and similar operations.
